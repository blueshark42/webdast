## `Created by Tom√°s, Phoebe, Claudia, and Roland`

Boys and girls in classrooms were asked to draw a scientist in a study several decades ago, the results revealed a stunning bias...

### webDAST provides the opportunity to test a lot more people around the world, therefore retrieving much more accurate results. Through further development, we will even be able to pinpoint certain communities, town, cities or countries on which the image of scientists is harmful to science, so that science educators can work on improving it!

By eliminating harmful bias in our science-oriented world, we can work towards accumulating more trust in science internationally!
